The integration automatically:
- **Tracks session completions** in Chrome local storage
- **Calculates NPS categories** (Promoter/Passive/Detractor)
- **Routes to correct form** based on user score
- **Respects user preferences** (won't spam if declined)
- **Re-engages appropriately** (asks again after 6 sessions if initially declined)
