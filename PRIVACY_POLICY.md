# Privacy Policy for Mindlessly

**Last updated:** January 6, 2026

## Overview

Mindlessly is a Chrome browser extension designed to help users browse the web more mindfully by setting intentions and using focus timers. This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information.

## Information We Collect

### Data Stored Locally
Mindlessly stores the following information **locally on your device**:

- **Website Lists**: URLs you've added to use with Mindlessly
- **User Intentions**: The purpose/intention text you enter for each browsing session
- **Timer Preferences**: Your selected timer durations and settings
- **Usage Statistics**: Number of completed focus sessions (for feedback prompts)
- **Feedback Data**: NPS scores and feedback submission status
- **Extension Settings**: Your preferences for timer schedules and display options
- **Anonymous User ID**: A randomly generated identifier (NOT personally identifiable)

### Data Collected for Product Improvement (Usage Analytics)
To help us improve Mindlessly, we automatically collect **anonymous usage analytics** when you provide an NPS rating:

- **NPS Score**: Your 0-10 rating when prompted (after 2+ sessions)
- **Rating Category**: Promoter, passive, or detractor classification
- **Anonymous User ID**: A random identifier (e.g., "user_1234567890_abc123") that is NOT linked to your identity
- **Session Count**: Number of focus sessions completed
- **Timestamp**: When you provided the rating

**What we DO NOT collect:**
- Your name, email, or any personally identifiable information (unless you voluntarily provide it via feedback forms)
- Your browsing history or visited websites
- Website content you view
- Passwords or sensitive data
- Your intentions or timer preferences

## How We Use Your Information

**Local Data** (stored on your device only):
- Provide the mindful browsing experience
- Remember your website preferences
- Display your intentions during browsing sessions
- Track usage for appropriate feedback timing
- Maintain your extension settings

**Analytics Data** (sent to us anonymously):
- Understand product satisfaction via NPS scores
- Identify areas for improvement based on user ratings
- Track product adoption and usage patterns (anonymously)
- Make data-driven decisions about features and improvements

## Data Storage and Security

- **Local Storage**: Most data is stored locally in Chrome's secure storage system
- **Analytics Storage**: Anonymous NPS feedback is sent to Google Forms and stored in our secure Google account
- **No Cloud Sync**: Your personal data (intentions, websites, preferences) is never synced to any servers
- **User Control**: You can clear all local data by removing the extension or clearing Chrome storage
- **Anonymous by Design**: Usage analytics cannot be linked back to you personally

## Third-Party Services

### Google Forms (Automatic & Anonymous)
When you provide an NPS rating within the extension:
- **Google Forms**: Anonymous analytics are automatically sent to Google Forms for collection
- **What's Sent**: NPS score, category, anonymous user ID, session count, and timestamp
- **What's NOT Sent**: No personal information, browsing data, or identifiable information
- **Purpose**: Product improvement and satisfaction tracking
- **Privacy**: Data is anonymized and cannot be traced back to you

### Notion Forms (Optional & User-Initiated Only)
When you **voluntarily choose** to provide detailed feedback by clicking feedback links:
- **Notion Forms**: You may be directed to Notion (notion.so) - subject to Notion's privacy policy
- **Important**: These forms are completely **optional** and only accessed when you explicitly click a feedback link
- **Your Control**: You choose what information to share, including your email for follow-up
- **Separate from Analytics**: This is in addition to the anonymous NPS score we collect automatically

### Email Support
If you contact us for support:
- **Email**: Communications sent to divykairoth@gmail.com

## Updates to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Users will be notified of significant changes through:
- Extension update notifications

## Data Retention

- **Local Data**: Stored on your device until you uninstall the extension or clear Chrome data
- **Anonymous Analytics**: NPS scores and anonymous usage data stored indefinitely for product improvement
- **Voluntary Feedback**: Optional feedback forms are subject to the respective service's retention policies
- **Support Emails**: Retained only as long as necessary to provide support

**Important**: Since analytics data is anonymous and cannot be linked to you, we cannot delete your specific NPS submission upon request. However, no personally identifiable information is collected in these analytics.
