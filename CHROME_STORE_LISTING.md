## **Justification for Permissions**

**webNavigation**: Required to detect when users navigate to websites they've added to Mindlessly, enabling automatic injection of the intention-setting interface.

**storage**: Used to store user preferences, website lists, intentions, and usage statistics locally on the device. No data is transmitted to external servers.

**scripting (optional)**: Requested when users add a new website to inject the mindful browsing interface on that specific domain.

**host_permissions**: Necessary to inject the intention-setting interface on websites that users have explicitly chosen to browse mindfully.
